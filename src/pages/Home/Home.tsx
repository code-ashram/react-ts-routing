      <p>
        Welcome to where time stands still
        <br /> one leaves and no one will
        <br />Moon is full, never seems to change
        <br />Just labeled mentally deranged
        <br />Dream the same thing every night
        <br />I see our freedom in my sight
        <br />No locked doors, no windows barred
        <br />No things to make my brain seem scarred
      </p>
    </>
